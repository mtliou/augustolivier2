# Ultra-Low Latency Mode - Test Guide

## 🚀 What's New: ZERO-WAIT TTS Generation!

The system now generates TTS **immediately** as words arrive, without waiting for:
- Sentence completion
- Silence detection  
- Final transcripts
- Punctuation marks

### ⚡ Key Improvements:

1. **Instant TTS Generation**: Starts after just 3 words
2. **Natural Chunking**: 3-10 word chunks for smooth flow
3. **No Silence Waiting**: TTS begins immediately as you speak
4. **Smart Breaking**: Uses natural pause points (commas, semicolons)
5. **Ultra-Fast Response**: <100ms from speech to TTS start

## 📊 Latency Comparison:

| Mode | Wait For | Typical Latency | TTS Start |
|------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **OLD Conference** | Complete sentence + silence | 500-800ms | After sentence ends |
| **NEW Ultra-Low** | Just 3 words | 50-100ms | While still speaking |

## 🧪 Test Scripts:

### Test 1: Continuous Speech (No Pauses)
**Instructions**: Read continuously without pausing between phrases
```
Hello everyone I'm really excited to share our latest developments 
with you today because we have made incredible progress on the new 
artificial intelligence platform that will revolutionize how we work
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- TTS starts after "Hello everyone I'm" (3 words)
- Continues in 3-10 word chunks
- No waiting for you to pause
- Natural flow maintained

### Test 2: Technical Presentation 
**Instructions**: Read at normal pace with slight pauses at commas
```
Our system processes millions of transactions per second,
achieves ninety-five percent accuracy,
and scales automatically based on demand,
while maintaining sub-millisecond response times
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Each comma-separated chunk plays immediately
- No accumulation of delay
- Natural breaks preserved

### Test 3: Rapid Fire List
**Instructions**: Read quickly without pauses
```
First we need to analyze the data
Second we optimize the algorithms  
Third we deploy to production
Fourth we monitor performance metrics
Fifth we iterate based on feedback
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Each item starts playing before you finish saying it
- Overlapping audio demonstrates ultra-low latency
- Adaptive speed kicks in if needed

### Test 4: Long Unbroken Sentence
**Instructions**: Read as one continuous stream
```
The revolutionary new system that we've been developing for the past 
six months incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms combined 
with real-time data processing capabilities to deliver unprecedented 
performance and reliability across all our global operations
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- TTS starts after ~3 words
- Continues in natural chunks
- No waiting for sentence end
- Smooth continuous playback

## 🎯 What to Listen For:

✅ **GOOD (Ultra-Low Latency)**:
- TTS starts while you're still speaking
- Natural 3-10 word chunks
- No silence gaps
- Smooth flow

❌ **BAD (Old Behavior)**:
- Waiting for complete sentences
- Long silence before TTS
- Accumulated delay
- Choppy playback

## 📈 Console Output:

You should see:
```
📝 [ULTRA] New words: [Hello everyone I'm really excited...] (5 words)
⚡ [ULTRA] Chunk #1 (3 words): "Hello everyone I'm..."
⚡ [ULTRA] Chunk #2 (4 words): "really excited to share..."
🔊 [ULTRA] Sent chunk #1 (3 words): "Hello everyone I'm..."
🔊 [ULTRA] Sent chunk #2 (4 words): "really excited to share..."
```

**Listener**: http://localhost:8080/listener-streaming.html

**Session Code**: TEST

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Partial Overlap**: You may hear TTS while still speaking - this is INTENDED
2. **Natural Flow**: Chunks are designed to sound natural even when split
3. **No Repetition**: Each chunk plays exactly once
4. **Immediate Response**: TTS should start within 100ms of speaking

## 🎉 Success Criteria:

- [ ] TTS starts before finishing first sentence
- [ ] No waiting for silence/pauses
- [ ] Natural sounding chunks
- [ ] <100ms perceived latency
- [ ] No repeated segments
- [ ] Smooth continuous flow
